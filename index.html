    <h1>Euro</h1>
    <p>
        The <Strong>euro</Strong>(symbol: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of 19 of the 27 member states of the
        European Union. This group of states is known as the eurozone or, officially, the euro area, and includes about
        343 million citizens as of 2019.[11][12] The euro, which is divided into 100 cents, is the second-largest and
        second-most traded currency in the international markets for the related different types of transactions after
        the United States dollar.[13] </p>

    <p>
        The currency is also used officially by the institutions of the European Union, by four European microstates
        that are not EU members,[12] the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, as well as unilaterally by
        Montenegro and Kosovo. Outside Europe, a number of special territories of EU members also use the euro as their
        currency. Additionally, over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro.#
    </p>

    <p>
        The euro is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world after
        the United States dollar.[14][15][16] As of December 2019, with more than €1.3 trillion in circulation, the euro
        has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world.[17][18]
    </p>

    <p>
        The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid.[19] The euro was introduced to world
        financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU)
        at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002,
        making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely
        replaced the former currencies.[20] While the euro dropped to US$0.83 within two years (26 October 2000), it has
        traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008 and since then returning
        near to its original issue rate. In late 2009, the euro became immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis,
        which led to the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at
        stabilising and strengthening the currency.

    <h2>Administration</h2>

    <p>
        The euro is managed and administered by the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem
        (composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole
        authority to set monetary policy. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of notes
        and coins in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.
    </p>


    <p>
        The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and
        budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. Denmark has negotiated exemptions,[21]
        while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a
        non-binding referendum in 2003, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the
        monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the
        euro in due course. The Maastricht Treaty was later amended by the Treaty of Nice,[22] which closed the gaps and
        loopholes in the Maastricht and Rome Treaties.

    <h3>Issuing modalities for banknotes</h3>

    <p>
        Since 1 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint
        basis.[23] Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem
        members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the
        Eurosystem.[23] In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring
        matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the
        ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB
        capital key,[23] calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP,
        equally weighted.[24]
    </p>
    <h4>Characteristics(Coins and banknotes)</h4>

    <p>
        The euro is divided into 100 cents (also referred to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from
        other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts
        the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, notwithstanding normal English usage.[25][26]
        Otherwise, normal English plurals are used,[27] with many local variations such as centime in France.
    </p>

    <p>
        All circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to
        the linguistic plurality in the European Union, the Latin alphabet version of euro is used (as opposed to the
        less common Greek or Cyrillic) and Arabic numerals (other text is used on national sides in national languages,
        but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, the map
        only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008
        (depending on the country), the old map was replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the EU
        like Norway, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Turkey.[citation needed] The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep
        their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above
        the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by Luc Luycx. The coins also have a national side showing an
        image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely
        used in any nation that has adopted the euro.
    </p>

    <p>
        The coins are issued in denominations of €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c. To avoid the use of the two
        smallest coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands and
        Ireland[28][29] (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland and Italy (by law).[30] This practice is discouraged by
        the commission, as is the practice of certain shops of refusing to accept high-value euro notes.[31]
    </p>
    <p>
        Commemorative coins with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the
        coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary
        of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004
        Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with
        various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and
        they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.[32]
    </p>
    <p>
        The design for the euro banknotes has common designs on both sides. The design was created by the Austrian
        designer Robert Kalina.[33] Notes are issued in €500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10, €5. Each banknote has its own
        colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of European architecture. The front of the note features windows
        or gateways while the back has bridges, symbolising links between states in the union and with the future. While
        the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics, the initial designs by Robert Kalina
        were of specific bridges, including the Rialto and the Pont de Neuilly, and were subsequently rendered more
        generic; the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes; thus they are not
        truly generic. The monuments looked similar enough to different national monuments to please everyone.[34]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Europa series, or second series, consists of six denominations and no longer includes the €500 with issuance
        discontinued as of 27 April 2019.[35] However, both the first and the second series of euro banknotes, including
        the €500, remain legal tender throughout the euro area.[35]
    </p>
    <p>
        In December 2021, the ECB announced it plans to redesign euro banknotes by 2024. A theme advisory group, made up
        of one member from each euro area country, was selected to submit theme proposals to the ECB. The proposals will
        be voted on by the public; a design competition will also be held.[36]
